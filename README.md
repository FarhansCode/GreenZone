I had the idea of writing my own IPv6-focused asset management webapp. It was
heavily misguided, poor code, and overall not a good approach. However, I was
proud that I was able to code in PHP.

## Code Flaws
1. Lack of MVC approach (SQL embedded in HTML pages)
2. Lack of input validation
3. Lack of Testing
4. Lack of documentation
5. Overall, I just did not follow any proper programming guidelines
